          <h3>Acne</h3>
          <p>
            Acne usually happens when pores get blocked with oil and dead skin.
            Hormones, stress, or harsh products can make it worse. A calm,
            balanced routine helps reduce breakouts over time.

          <h3>Pigmentation</h3>
          <p>
            Dark spots and uneven tone often appear after sun exposure or acne.
            Gentle care and daily protection help skin regain clarity slowly.

          <img src="assests/images/skin-sensitive.jpg" alt="Sensitive Skin" />
          <h3>Sensitive Skin</h3>
          <p>
            If your skin reacts easily, it usually means the barrier is weak.
            Simple routines and fewer products help restore comfort.

          <h3>Dandruff</h3>
          <p>
            Flakes and itching often come from scalp imbalance. The right
            cleansing routine can bring relief and control.

          <h3>Hair Fall</h3>
          <p>
            Hair fall may increase due to stress, nutrition, or scalp health.
            Understanding the cause is the first step to managing it.

          <h3>Oily Scalp</h3>
          <p>
            An oily scalp can make hair greasy quickly and clog follicles.
            Balanced washing keeps the scalp fresh and healthy.
